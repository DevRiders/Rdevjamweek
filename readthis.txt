take one variable isLoggedIn = false by default and
always check it brfore rendering any pages when the 
username and password is correct i will send the status 
and isLoggedIn to true then you render the all the protected
pages.during login and logout u take the isLoggedIn value from
server side and update it in client side and check that variable
always.

many more security and all ara available but we will do just this
much first for this project.
